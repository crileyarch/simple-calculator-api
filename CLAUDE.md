# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**simple-calculator-api** is a REST API that adds two numbers. This is a minimal project currently in early development with only a README file.

## Development Commands

Once the project is set up, common commands will likely include:

- **Build**: TBD (will depend on chosen tech stack - Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
- **Run**: TBD
- **Test**: TBD
- **Lint**: TBD

Update these sections as the tech stack and build tools are decided.

## Architecture Decisions to Make

Before implementing, clarify:

1. **Technology Stack**: What language/framework? (Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, Go, etc.)
2. **API Design**: RESTful endpoint(s) for calculator operations
3. **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for calculation logic, integration tests for API
4. **Deployment**: How will this be deployed? (Docker, serverless, etc.)
5. **Input Validation**: How should invalid inputs be handled?

## High-Level Architecture (TBD)

Once implementation begins:

- **API Layer**: HTTP endpoint(s) that accept numbers and return results
- **Logic Layer**: Calculator function(s) that perform arithmetic
- **Testing**: Unit tests for calculation logic, API endpoint tests

## Project Structure (TBD)

Once created, document the actual structure here with explanations of key directories/files.

## Notes

- The README indicates this is a simple calculator that "adds two numbers" - clarify if other operations will be supported
- Keep implementation minimal and focused on the core functionality
